                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p class="description">
                 I am a B.Tech student pursuing a degree in Information Technology at KIIT University, Bhubaneswar. My academic journey has been both enriching and challenging, allowing me to develop a strong foundation in technology and innovation.
            <br><br>I have a deep interest in the fields of Cloud Computing and Artificial Intelligence (AI), two domains that are reshaping the future of technology. Cloud Computing fascinates me with its ability to offer scalable, on-demand solutions that empower businesses and individuals alike. Similarly, Artificial Intelligence has captivated my curiosity with its potential to replicate and enhance human intelligence in problem-solving.
            <br><br>With a strong passion for technology and a drive to make meaningful contributions, I aim to carve a niche for myself in the dynamic world of Cloud Computing and Artificial Intelligence.
            <br><br>Apart from studies in my free time, I enjoy immersing myself in the world of video games, which offer both relaxation and a chance to experience thrilling adventures and stories. Additionally, I love watching web series, which provide an excellent escape with their engaging narratives and diverse genres.
            <br><br>One of my greatest passions is photography. Capturing the beauty of the world through the lens of a camera is a creative outlet that brings me immense joy. Nowadays, I am mainly focused on improving my photographic skills and experimenting with new techniques to elevate my work.<br><br>Visit my Photography portfolio.
