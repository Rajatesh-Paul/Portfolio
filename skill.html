        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p><strong>1. Parkinson’s Disease detection using ML - <br>Feb 2025 - Mar 2025</strong> <br>Built a machine learning model using SVM to predict Parkinson's disease based on voice measurements. While MRI imaging would have been ideal for better accuracy, the dataset was not freely available, and the current dataset was relatively small. Achieved high accuracy with feature scaling, data visualization, and performance evaluation using confusion matrix and ROC-AUC. Our model achieved an accuracy of 87% on the test dataset.</p>
        <p><strong>2.  Portfolio Website - <br>Jan 2025 – Jan 2025</strong> <br>This Portfolio website is designed using front-end web development technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, for a visually appealing and responsive user experience. To integrate cloud services, the website is hosted on Amazon S3 and GitHub for high availability, scalability, and cost-effective static website hosting. <br>The project combines expertise in front-end development and cloud computing, emphasizing both creative design and technical deployment.
This project serves as a practical application of my skills in web development and cloud services, providing a complete end-to-end solution for building and hosting websites.</p>
